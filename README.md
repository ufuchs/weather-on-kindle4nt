weather-on-kindle4nt
=====================

## Features

- The original function as an ebook reader remains
- Doesn't require any crontab usage
- Caches the last successfully downloaded weather file until it expires at 24:00
  (So you can take away your 'weather station' in the pub and show it all your friends.)
- The download is written in the '/tmp' directory which is a temporary filesystem(32M), living in the memory

__Note__
You need to install [kite](https://github.com/ufuchs/kite-kindle4nt) to launch the program.  
_Before_ that you have to jailbreak the Kindle and to install the [USBNetwork Hacks](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004)
Please use the
